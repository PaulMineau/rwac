## Rebel Without a Cause
<img src="Albert-Camus.jpg" />

## The Mission

- Phase I (one hour) We don't know what the mission is, and at this phase, we are rebels without a cause. We will analyze the data available and suggest various hypothesis.
- Phase II - By utilizing Infographics, and data visualization we will explain the data to ourselves and others. Any data scientists will build models that provide non-obvious insight
- Phase III - publish an article, design a graffiti based Infographic, potentially publish the graffiti at approved location (tent city?). Publish a slideshow like this which tells the story of our effort today.

## Data Exploration 

- Here's some visualizations to get started. Please find more like these at <a href="http://data.seattle.gov" target="_blank">data.seattle.gov</a>

## More Exploration
Visit <a href="http://data.seattle.gov" target="_blank">data.seattle.gov</a>. Now find more data sources. You can filter by category, and by content type. There are maps, graphs, and raw data.Your job is to find some.

## Git Repo
https://github.com/PaulMineau/rwac.git
I generated this slideshow entirely in R Studio using knitr. The git repository for this site is at 
Pushing to this website will automatically deploy to this website. Any d3 can easily be added and checked in. This slideshow will become a tour through some of these visualizations and data sets as some story is told, and the viewer is no longer without a cause.

## R Script output in the slideshow

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

The End
